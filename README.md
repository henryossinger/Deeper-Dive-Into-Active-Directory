# Deeper-Dive-Into-Active-Directory

<h2>Preface</h2>
About a year ago I posted a repository where I did some very basic configuration of an Active Directory domain controller in an Azure VM. Now that I have a physical server, I thought it would be neat to do a much deeper dive into what is possible within Active Directory. I plan to cover server configuration, creating policies for users and groups, automating basic tasks, and more within this module. 

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- VMWare Workstation Pro 17 (Hypervisor)
- Windows Server 2022
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell
